# Swift CodeReview Checklist
As iOS Software Engineer, i've been always looking to have a checklist to check against my code.Most of Software Engineers are usually interested in writing clean code that is working fine, meeting requirements and also easy to understand and maintain.
So i thought about creating a basic iOS checklist and let the iOS developers community enhance it so we can have a great checklist common for all iOS Apps.
As Apple now believes in the power of the community and made Swift Open Source, we as iOS community need to think in the same direction and create a good checklist that can be used as reference to any iOS developer around the world looking to deliver a high end product.
